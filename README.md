**Mochi-Enhance** is a research-driven framework for significantly improving the temporal consistency and semantic alignment of the **Mochi-1-preview** open-weight video diffusion model.

Our methodology achieves superior results **without any fine-tuning or external post-processing networks**, leveraging native model manipulations during the diffusion process.

## Key Improvements

By independently manipulating the **Flow Match Euler Discrete Scheduler**, injecting **structured negative embeddings**, and amplifying **classifier-free guidance**, we achieve:

* **+1.3% Absolute SSIM Improvement**: Smoother, more stable temporal consistency.
* **-21% LPIPS Reduction**: Drastic reduction in visual artifacts and "morphing" effects.
* **Zero Computational Overhead**: Enhancements run natively during diffusion with no extra latency.
* **Improved Prompt Adherence**: Higher CLIP-SIM scores for complex prompts.

### Qualitative Comparison

## Features

* **Parallelized Ablation Suite**: Automatically runs 75+ experiments across multiple GPUs using PyTorch multiprocessing.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Built-in lazy-loading metrics suite for CLIP-SIM, SSIM, LPIPS, and Fréchet Video Distance (FVD).
* **Interactive Demo**: A dedicated Gradio GUI for real-time comparison and metric visualization.
* **Visualization Engine**: Automated generation of publication-ready LaTeX tables, bar charts, and variance plots.

## Computational Requirements

Mochi-1-preview is a large-scale video diffusion model (~10B parameters). To ensure the pipeline runs smoothly without CUDA out-of-memory errors, please note the following requirements:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GPU Memory (VRAM):**
>
> * **Optimal:** 48GB+ (e.g., NVIDIA A6000, A100) for full-speed inference and parallel ablation studies.
> * **Minimum:** 24GB (e.g., RTX 3090, 4090). The code is optimized with `enable_model_cpu_offload()` and `enable_vae_tiling()` to support high-end consumer hardware.

* **System RAM:** 64GB or more is highly recommended to handle model weights and CPU offloading.
* **Disk Space:** Approximately 30GB for model weights (downloaded automatically via Hugging Face) and generated artifacts.
* **Software:** Linux or Windows with WSL2 is recommended for optimal PyTorch performance.
